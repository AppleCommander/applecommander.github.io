The AppleCommander libraries are available in the Maven repository:

```
<dependency>
 <groupId>net.sf.applecommander</groupId>
 <artifactId>AppleCommander</artifactId>
 <version>1.3.5.14</version>
</dependency>
```

This is a manual release process, so it may take a bit of time (and possibly some prodding).

Notes:

* There are no plans to change from `net.sf.applecommander` in the GAV. (It should have been `com.webcodepro.applecommander`, however, that domain was given up long ago.)
* The Java packages will remain `com.webcodepro.applecommander` as everyone depends on that package scheme.
