!!! info "Legacy"
    Older releases were from sourceforge and are considered legacy. Please use a more current release from [GitHub](https://github.com/AppleCommander/AppleCommander).

A new release of AppleCommander is available. Version 1.1.1 brings AppleWorks word processor (AWP) file exporting, multiple files can be exported at once, the wizard "guesses" the file type, along with minor bug fixes and enhancements.

With this release, AppleCommander is GPL. The home page has now moved to:

    http://applecommander.sourceforge.net/

The SourceForge project page is located at:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/applecommander/

If you're interested, please take a peek. Now that AppleCommander is hosted at SourceForge, you may submit bugs or requests, browse the code, or even contribute code!
