A new release of AppleCommander is available. Version 1.1.0 brings in file exporting and filtering (if chosen). File export types include raw disk, binary, ASCII text, Applesoft BASIC, Integer BASIC, and Graphics modes (Hires and Double Hires).

AppleCommander reads and DOS 3.3, ProDOS, Apple Pascal, and RDOS formatted disks - and reads compressed (`*.gz`) images, 140K DOS ordered (`*.do`, `*.dsk`), 140K ProDOS ordered (`*.po`), 800K ProDOS ordered (`*.2img`, `*.2mg`), and 32MB ApplePC hard disk images (`*.hdv`).

If you're interested, come and take a peek!
