A new release of AppleCommander is available! Version 1.2.3 concentrated work on being able to build a Windows executable.

* Separated image support for GraphicsFileFilter. This allows easier preparation for compiling AppleCommander as a Windows executable (and allows limited image support to boot).
* Compile into native executable (Windows works now).
* Work on identifying why GCJ introduces slow performance to some areas. This appears to be resolved with an early build of GCJ 3.3.
