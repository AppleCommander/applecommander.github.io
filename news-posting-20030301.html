A new release of AppleCommander is available.  Version 1.2.1 is 
primarily a clean-up operation.  However, there is a bit of new 
functionality - AppleWorks Spread Sheet (ASP) and Data Base (ADB) 
files can both be exported to a *.csv file format.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Now carries margin setting through, sets font to Courier New
  (more realistic formatting), and fixes boldface not being
  turned off correctly when converting AWP files to RTF format.</li>
<li>Import could/should choose the filetype based upon the file
  extension for files being imported. Mostly useful for ProDOS;
  unless a filetype mapping is introduced.</li>
<li>Export of AppleWorks Data Base files.</li>
<li>Export of AppleWorks Spread Sheet files.</li>
<li>Fixed minor issue with ProDOS disks where files at the 128K
  border would be grown (incorrectly) into a Tree file (instead 
  of a Sapling).</li>
<li>Import of multiple files fails after multiple imports.  This
  was an issue with ProDOS files >128K ("Tree" files).  The
  delete code didn't handle the master index block
  appropriately when blocks numbered zero were present
  (normally indicating the end of file).</li>
<li>DOS 3.3 was not writing correct number of sectors if a file
  was more than 256 sectors long.</li>
<li>DOS 3.3 was not managing deleted file entries appropriately
  and tried to work with track $FF.</li>
<li>Fixed offset calculation for 800K DOS organized disks.  This
  primarily affected UniDOS.</li>
<li>Import menu should be in directory pane instead of file pane.</li>
<li>The information tab does not get updated.  Now that the disk
  can be modified, this page needs to be updated when shown.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm still putzing with a compiled version for Linux and Windows, so 
they haven't shown up as of yet.
