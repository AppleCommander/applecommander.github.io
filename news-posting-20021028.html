I am working on a general Apple2 disk image utility.  Why?  I haven't found any
one utility that does everything for transferring files in and out of disk
images - and, besides, I'm thoroughly enjoying 'retro computing'.
</p>

<p>
Currently, it reads and displays the contents of disks.  It supports DOS 3.3,
ProDOS, Apple Pascal, and RDOS formatted disks - and reads compressed (*.gz)
images, 140K DOS ordered (*.do, *.dsk), 140K ProDOS ordered (*.po), 800K ProDOS
ordered (*.2img, *.2mg), and 32MB ApplePC hard disk images (*.hdv).  This
doesn't cover all image formats, but covers the ones I needed/wanted to have
covered - it can be expanded relatively easily.
</p>

<p>
Future direction are to (a) have the ability to extract files from images and
(b) to import files into images.
</p>

<p>
Two caveats - it is written in Java (you need the JVM installed to run it), and
I also have been using this as an excuse to work with the Eclipse.org SWT
windowing libray (which will need to be downloaded also).  However, the upside
to this is that it should run wherever Java and SWT run (Windows, Linux,
and Mac OS X right now).

If you're interested, come and take a peek!
