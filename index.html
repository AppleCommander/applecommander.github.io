<h2><a name='about'>About</a></h2>
<p>
AppleCommander is a little project whose main purpose is to provide a
tool to move data between Apple ][ disk images and a native filesystem
('C:\' for Windows, or '/wherever' for Linux and Mac OS X).  As with all
good projects, this one is a little out of hand, and it is becoming a
general utility to manipulate Apple ][ emulator images.  If you're
thinking this could be useful, read on!
</p>
<p>
Some secondary (or tertiary, depending on what you are counting)
considerations are to give me a bit of experience using <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">Eclipse.org</a>'s <a
href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-swt-home/main.html" target="_blank">SWT</a> (Standard Widget Toolkit) -
which is an alternative windowing system to Sun's AWT or Swing.

<h2><a name='capabilities'>Capabilities</a></h2>
<p>
As stated above, AppleCommander is intended to become a general utility
for disk images.  But, where is it now? What are the current capabilities?
</p>
<p>
AppleCommander is currently able to read and display information about
disk images, export files of various types, create disk images, import
files into disk images, and has a rudimentary compiler.  As of
<b>1.3.5</b>, AppleCommander incorporates support for <a
href="http://www.cc65.org/">cc65</a> and an improved<a
href='acguide.html'> command-line</a> and even an <a href="acant.html">ant</a> interface.
</p>
Disk image organizations currently supported:
<ul>
<li>Compressed images (*.gz);</li>
<li>140K DOS-ordered images (*.do, *.dsk);</li>
<li>140K ProDOS-ordered images (*.po);</li>
<li>140K Nibble (DOS ordered) images (*.nib);</li>
<li>800K ProDOS-ordered images (*.2mg, *.2img);</li>
<li>32MB ApplePC Hard Disk images (*.hdv).</li>
</ul>
Disk formats currently supported (ie, operating systems):
<ul>
<li>DOS 3.3 (140K formats only);</li>
<li>UniDOS, OzDOS (800K formats only);</li>
<li>ProDOS;</li>
<li>Apple Pascal (140K and 800K formats);</li>
<li>SSI's RDOS (140K formats only);</li>
<li>CP/M (probably only 140K formats).</li>
</ul>
File export filters:
<ul>
<li>Raw disk data (dumps blocks or sectors without regard to file length or operating system storage);</li>
<li>Binary file (dumps file without any conversion);</li>
<li>Hex dump;</li>
<li>ASCII file filter;</li>
<li>Formatted assembly output;</li>
<li>Pascal ".text" files;</li>
<li>Applesoft BASIC file filter (file is de-tokenized and written out as a text file);</li>
<li>Integer BASIC file filter (ditto);</li>
<li>Graphic image file filter (supports black and white or color Hires images as well as black and white or color Double Hires images as well as standard Super Hires, and 3200 color Super Hires);</li>
<li>AppleWorks word processor (AWP) file filter (converts to text, poor HTML, or Rich-Text Format (RTF));</li>
<li>AppleWorks database (ADB) file filter (converts to CSV);</li>
<li>AppleWorks spread sheet (ASP) file filter (converts to CSV).</li>
</ul>
Compile capabilities (BETA):
<ul>
<li>Applesoft BASIC</li>
</ul>
Viewer capabilities:
<ul>
<li>BASIC programs (Applesoft and Integer BASIC); Applesoft BASIC is colored</li>
<li>Graphics images (same as supported by the graphics export function)</li>
<li>Appleworks (database, spreadsheet, word processor)</li>
<li>Text files (plain text, assembly source files, Pascal text files)</li>
<li>Hex dump of all the above</li>
<li>"Raw" format of all of the above; this includes all data as read from disk
    including length and starting address as well as full sectors/blocks</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name='issues'>Issues</a></h2>
Known issues with AppleCommander:
<ul>
<li>If a disk is mostly in a known format, but has bad data and what-not, AppleCommander may crash.  Technically, the worst culprit is a retrieving a non-existant block or track/sector.</li>
<li>Various interface improvements.</li>
<li>Requirement of a Java JVM as well as SWT for the interface.</li>
<li>The Win32 (compiled) version of AppleCommander doesn't interpret graphic image colors correctly - however the Java JAR version does.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h2><a name='future'>Future</a></h2>
<p>
There is a general list of TODO items which is managed as part of the
CVS archive. Click <a

here</a> to see the current TODO list.
</p>

<p>
Does the future include you?  Anyone is welcome to suggest or contribute!
</p>

<h2><a name='requirements'>Requirements</a></h2>
<p>
AppleCommander is written in Java and uses a non-standard Java library,
SWT.  Fortunately, none of these will cost anything but download time:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Java</b> - If you need to install Java, go to the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html">Sun Java</a> site for
J2SE and download the latest version (1.4.2 as of June 2004) and install
it.  I develop with 1.4.2_04, and have tested with 1.3.1, so these
should work along with any future releases. </li>
<li><b>SWT</b> - As far as SWT is concerned, I have created a Windows
archive (1MB) of these files which you can unzip into the same directory
as the AppleCommander JAR file.  The Mac bundle includes the SWT files.
For the latest release of SWT, <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/'>
visit the Eclipse site</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because of the SWT difficulties, I hope to continue <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-nativegui/"
target="_blank">compiling</a> the application.  These will be tagged with a win32 in
the filename.
</p>

<h2><a name='download'>Download</a></h2>
<p>
<b>Note: Please read the requirements and download Java and the SWT code, if required first!</b>
</p>
<p>
Once you have installed Java and copied SWT into the future AppleCommander directory, download  a copy of AppleCommander
from the <a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67414'>download
section of the SourceForge site</a>.
</p>
<p>
This software is distributed under the 
<a href='http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php'>GPL</a>.
</p>
<p>
To start AppleCommander, just double-click on the AppleCommander JAR file!
If you've downloaded the win32 version, double-click on the EXE file.
One Mac, double-click AppleCommander.app; recent libraries are included.
</p>

<h2><a name='developer'>Developer Documentation</a></h2>
<p>
There is currently minimal documentation available for others interested in the development,
structure, or code of AppleCommander.  The source is, of course, available on
<a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/applecommander/'>SourceForge</a> via
<a href='http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=67414'>CVS</a>.  However,
extra documentation is fairly sparse at this time.
</p>
<p>
For your web-browsing pleasure, the <a href='javadoc/'>AppleCommander Java Documentation</a>
has been uploaded, and I will try to keep it up-to-date.  (If not, the code is documented,
and you can generate it yourself.)
</p>
<p>
Additionally, <a href='http://www.eclipseuml.com'>EclipseUML</a> has been used to generate the UML
diagrams which have been drawn by hand.  <a href='uml/index.html'>These UML diagrams</a> don't cover all
of AppleCommander, but they do give the general structure used by the "storage" package - that is,
the domain in which AppleCommander specializes.
