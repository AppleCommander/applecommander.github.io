<h2><a name='about'>About</a></h2>
<p>
AppleCommander is a little project whose main purpose is to provide a tool to move data between Apple ][ disk images
and a native filesystem ('C:\' for Windows, or '/wherever' for Linux and Mac OS X).  As with all good projects, this one is a little out of hand, and it is becoming a general
utility to manipulate Apple ][ emulator images.  If you're thinking this could be useful, read on!
</p>
<p>
Some secondary (or tertiary, depending on what you are counting) considerations are to give me a bit of experience
using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">Eclipse.org</a>'s
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-swt-home/main.html" target="_blank">SWT</a>
(Standard Widget Toolkit) - which is an alternative windowing system to Sun's AWT or Swing.
In theory, at least, using SWT will also enable AppleCommander to be compiled into
native code on a variety of platforms.  (Note the "theory" part - AppleCommander
isn't this far yet.)

<h2><a name='capabilities'>Capabilities</a></h2>
<p>
As stated above, AppleCommander is intended to become a general utility for disk images.  But, where is it now? What
are the current capabilites?
</p>
<p>
AppleCommander is currently able to read and display information about disk images as well as export files of various
file types.  Future releases are slated to address importing files and maybe add drag and drop capabilities.
</p>
Disk image organizations currently supported:
<ul>
<li>Compressed images (*.gz);</li>
<li>140K DOS-ordered images (*.do, *.dsk);</li>
<li>140K ProDOS-ordered images (*.po);</li>
<li>800K ProDOS-ordered images (*.2mg, *.2img);</li>
<li>32MB ApplePC Hard Disk images (*.hdv).</li>
</ul>
Disk formats currently supported (ie, operating systems):
<ul>
<li>DOS 3.3 (140K formats only);</li>
<li>ProDOS;</li>
<li>Apple Pascal (140K formats only);</li>
<li>SSI's RDOS (140K formats only).</li>
</ul>
File export filters:
<ul>
<li>Raw disk data (dumps blocks or sectors without regard to file length or operating system storage);</li>
<li>Binary file (dumps file without any converstion);</li>
<li>ASCII file filter;</li>
<li>Applesoft BASIC file filter (file is de-tokenized and written out as a text file);</li>
<li>Integer BASIC file filter (ditto);</li>
<li>Graphic image file filter (supports black and white or color Hires images as
    well as black and white or color Double Hires images).</li>
<li>AppleWorks word processor (AWP) file filter (converts to text or poor HTML)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name='issues'>Issues</a></h2>
Known issues with AppleCommander:
<ul>
<li>If a disk is mostly in a known format, but has bad data and what-not,
    AppleCommander may crash.  Technically, the worst culprit is a retrieving a non-existant block
    or track/sector.</li>
<li>Various interface improvements.</li>
<li>Requirement of a Java JVM as well as SWT for the interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please visit the <a href='http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=67414'>tracker</a> page
for an up-to-date list of issues, submit a new issue, or submit a feature request.
</p>

<h2><a name='future'>Future</a></h2>
<p>
There is a general list of TODO items.  Some have been assigned to a target build, and are itemized below:
</p>
Release 1.2
<ul>
<li>Import files;</li>
<li>Create disk images.</li>
</ul>
Not assigned a version - idea stage:
<ul>
<li>Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT;</li>
<li>Provide a command-line interface (scripting - ie, mass load).</li>
<li>Add drag-and-drop capability.</li>
<li>Compile into native executable (hopefully Linux and Windows).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name='requirements'>Requirements</a></h2>
<p>
AppleCommander is written in Java and uses a non-standard Java library, SWT.  Fortunately, none of these will
cost anything but download time:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Java</b> -
    If you need to install Java, go to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html">Sun Java</a> site for
    J2SE and download the latest version (1.4.1 as of October 2002) and install it.  I develop with 1.4.0_01, and have tested
    with 1.3.1, so these should work along with any future releases.
    </li>
<li><b>SWT</b> -
    As far as SWT is concerned, I have created a <a href='downloads/swt-win32-2049.zip'>Windows archive (1MB)</a> of these files
    which you can unzip into the same directory as the AppleCommander JAR file.  For those running Linux, fish around the
    <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-swt-home/main.html" target="_blank">SWT</a>
    site, or try a <a href='http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=linux+swt+jar' target="_blank">Google
    search</a> - <a href='http://www.erights.org/download/swt/linux/linux-motif/' target="_blank">this site</a> provides
    a few binaries.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Because of the SWT difficulties, I hope to either <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-nativegui/"
target="_blank">compile</a> the code to be a native executable or to remove the SWT dependency (see <a href='#future'>Future</a>
section) to make AppleCommander easier to access.  The design of AppleCommander actually should make this fairly
easy, as the user interface code is completely separate from the code that handles the disk images,
</p>

<h2><a name='download'>Download</a></h2>
<p>
<b>Note: Please read the requirements and download Java and the SWT code, if required first!</b>
</p>
<p>
Once you have installed Java and copied SWT into the future AppleCommander directory, download  a copy of AppleCommander
from the <a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67414'>download
section of the SourceForge site</a>.
