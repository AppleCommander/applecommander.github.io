<h2><a name='about'>About</a></h2>
<p>
AppleCommander is a little project whose main purpose is to provide a tool to move data between Apple ][ disk images
and a native filesystem ('C:\' for Windows, or '/wherever' for Linux and Mac OS X).  As with all good projects, this one is a little out of hand, and it is becoming a general
utility to manipulate Apple ][ emulator images.  If you're thinking this could be useful, read on!
</p>
<p>
Some secondary (or tertiary, depending on what you are counting) considerations are to give me a bit of experience
using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">Eclipse.org</a>'s
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-swt-home/main.html" target="_blank">SWT</a>
(Standard Widget Toolkit) - which is an alternative windowing system to Sun's AWT or Swing.

<h2><a name='capabilities'>Capabilities</a></h2>
<p>
As stated above, AppleCommander is intended to become a general utility for disk images.  But, where is it now? What
are the current capabilites?
</p>
<p>
AppleCommander is currently able to read and display information about disk images, export files of various
types, create disk images, import files into disk images, and has a rudimentary compiler.  As of 1.3.1, 
AppleCommander has added an internal file viewer and incorporates John Matthews 
<a href='http://www.wright.edu/~john.matthews/ac.html'>command-line</a> version.
</p>
Disk image organizations currently supported:
<ul>
<li>Compressed images (*.gz);</li>
<li>140K DOS-ordered images (*.do, *.dsk);</li>
<li>140K ProDOS-ordered images (*.po);</li>
<li>140K Nibble (DOS ordered) images (*.nib);</li>
<li>800K ProDOS-ordered images (*.2mg, *.2img);</li>
<li>32MB ApplePC Hard Disk images (*.hdv).</li>
</ul>
Disk formats currently supported (ie, operating systems):
<ul>
<li>DOS 3.3 (140K formats only);</li>
<li>UniDOS, OzDOS (800K formats only);</li>
<li>ProDOS;</li>
<li>Apple Pascal (140K formats only);</li>
<li>SSI's RDOS (140K formats only);</li>
<li>CP/M (probably only 140K formats).</li>
</ul>
File export filters:
<ul>
<li>Raw disk data (dumps blocks or sectors without regard to file length or operating system storage);</li>
<li>Binary file (dumps file without any converstion);</li>
<li>Hex dump;</li>
<li>ASCII file filter;</li>
<li>Applesoft BASIC file filter (file is de-tokenized and written out as a text file);</li>
<li>Integer BASIC file filter (ditto);</li>
<li>Graphic image file filter (supports black and white or color Hires images as
    well as black and white or color Double Hires images as well as standard Super Hires,
    and 3200 color Super Hires);</li>
<li>AppleWorks word processor (AWP) file filter (converts to text, poor HTML, or
	Rich-Text Format (RTF));</li>
<li>AppleWorks database (ADB) file filter (converts to CSV);</li>
<li>AppleWorks spread sheet (ASP) file filter (converts to CSV).</li>
</ul>
Compile capabilities (BETA):
<ul>
<li>Applesoft BASIC</li>
</ul>
Viewer capabilities:
<ul>
<li>BASIC programs (Applesoft and Integer BASIC); Applesoft BASIC is colored</li>
<li>Graphics images (same as supported by the graphics export function)</li>
<li>Appleworks (database, spreadsheet, word processor)</li>
<li>Text files</li>
<li>Hex dump of all the above</li>
<li>"Raw" format of all of the above; this includes all data as read from disk
    including length and starting address as well as full sectors/blocks</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name='issues'>Issues</a></h2>
Known issues with AppleCommander:
<ul>
<li>If a disk is mostly in a known format, but has bad data and what-not,
    AppleCommander may crash.  Technically, the worst culprit is a retrieving a non-existant block
    or track/sector.</li>
<li>Various interface improvements.</li>
<li>Requirement of a Java JVM as well as SWT for the interface.</li>
<li>The Win32 (compiled) version of AppleCommander doesn't interpret graphic
    image colors correctly - however the Java JAR version does.</li>
<li>There is a known issue with Mac OS X: Somehow the windows do not come into the foreground.
    The windows can be closed but not interacted with.  Any help appreciated!  (This is most
    likely due to a misuse of the Eclipse SWT library on my part.)
</ul>

<h2><a name='future'>Future</a></h2>
<p>
There is a general list of TODO items which is managed as part of the CVS archive.
Click <a href='http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/applecommander/AppleCommander/TODO?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup'>here</a>
to see the current TODO list.
</p>

<h2><a name='requirements'>Requirements</a></h2>
<p>
AppleCommander is written in Java and uses a non-standard Java library, SWT.  Fortunately, none of these will
cost anything but download time:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Java</b> -
    If you need to install Java, go to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html">Sun Java</a> site for
    J2SE and download the latest version (1.4.1 as of October 2002) and install it.  I develop with 1.4.0_01, and have tested
    with 1.3.1, so these should work along with any future releases.
    </li>
<li><b>SWT</b> -
    As far as SWT is concerned, I have created a <a href='downloads/swt-win32-2049.zip'>Windows archive (1MB)</a> of these files
    which you can unzip into the same directory as the AppleCommander JAR file.  For those running Linux, fish around the
    <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-swt-home/main.html" target="_blank">SWT</a>
    site, or try a <a href='http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=linux+swt+jar' target="_blank">Google
    search</a> - <a href='http://www.erights.org/download/swt/linux/linux-motif/' target="_blank">this site</a> provides
    a few binaries.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Because of the SWT difficulties, I hope to continue <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-nativegui/"
target="_blank">compiling</a> the application.  These will be tagged with a win32 in
the filename.
</p>

<h2><a name='download'>Download</a></h2>
<p>
<b>Note: Please read the requirements and download Java and the SWT code, if required first!</b>
</p>
<p>
Once you have installed Java and copied SWT into the future AppleCommander directory, download  a copy of AppleCommander
from the <a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67414'>download
section of the SourceForge site</a>.
</p>
<p>
This software is distributed under the <a href='http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php'>GPL</a>.
</p>
<p>
To start AppleCommander, just double-click on the AppleCommander JAR file!  (If you've
downloaded the win32 version, double-click on the EXE file.)
</p>

<h2><a name='developer'>Developer Documentation</a></h2>
<p>
There is currently minimal documentation available for others interested in the development,
structure, or code of AppleCommander.  The source is, of course, available on
<a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/applecommander/'>SourceForge</a> via
<a href='http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/applecommander/'>CVS</a>.  However,
extra documentation is fairly sparse at this time.
</p>
<p>
For your web-browsing pleasure, the <a href='javadoc/'>AppleCommander Java Documentation</a>
has been uploaded, and I will try to keep it up-to-date.  (If not, the code is documented,
and you can generate it yourself.)
</p>
<p>
Additionally, <a href='http://www.eclipseuml.com'>EclipseUML</a> has been used to generate the UML
diagrams which have been drawn by hand.  <a href='uml/'>These UML diagrams</a> don't cover all
of AppleCommander, but they do give the general structure used by the "storage" package - that is,
the domain in which AppleCommander specializes.
