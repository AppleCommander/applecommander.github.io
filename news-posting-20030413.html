<p>
A new release of AppleCommander is available! Version 1.2.3 concentrated
work on being able to build a Windows executable. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Separated image support for GraphicsFileFilter.  This allows easier preparation
  for compiling AppleCommander as a Windows executable (and allows limited image
  support to boot).</li>
<li>Compile into native executable (Windows works now).</li>
<li>Work on identifying why GCJ introduces slow performance to some areas.  This
  appears to be resolved with an early build of GCJ 3.3.</li>
</ul>
