<p>New for version 1.3.3 (2004-06-18):</p>

<ul>
<li>Repackage code - packages were getting a bit large.  The goal is to make class
  structure/placement more logical.
  GUI:
  <ul>
  <li>Moved the SWT wizards into their own packages;</li>
  <li>Separated utility classes into the util package;</li>
  <li>Main application windows remain in swt package.</li>
  </ul>
  Storage:
  <ul>
  <li>Moved OS formats into their respective packages in the "os" package
    (dos33, prodos, cpm, rdos, pascal);</li>
  <li>Filters are now in the filters package;</li>
  <li>General storage classes remain under storage (Disk, FormattedDisk, etc).</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>Added formatted assembly FileFilter.  Understands Merlin format source files.
  Need to recognize various formats - T.*, *.S, etc.  Need examples for other
  formats (Orca, APW, etc).</li>
<li>File viewer window now scrolls an appropriate amount: PgUp/PgDn, arrows, 
  mousewheel all work (must select content area first of course).</li>
<li>Wizard windows no longer show up with the title bar off the screen.</li>
<li>Refactored FileViewerWindow.  Created supporting FilterAdapter classes as well as 
  (presumably) reusable ContentAdapters.  Started caching the filtered content for
  a little speed improvement when switching filters (native, hex, raw) in the FileView.</li>
<li>Hans Otten provided information on Apple Pascal's formatting of ".text" files - they
  are now read correctly with appropriate character spacing and header section is ignored.</li>
<li>Fixed error where viewing an invalid graphics file crashed AppleCommander (typically was
  too short).  This can be done by context menu -> View As -> Graphics.</li>
<li>Further automated build (and web site) deployment.
  Ant now builds source zip, GUI JAR, command-line jar, javadoc, and website.  Website zip
  file only needs to be extracted into the web root to be deployed.  Windows executable is
  scripted but not plugged into the Ant script at this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
[The End.]
