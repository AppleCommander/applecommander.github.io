<p>New for version 1.3.2 (2004-06-05):</p>

<ul>
<li>Print file listing or full disk listing (including subdirectories or multiple
  volumes).</li>
<li>Added support for Super Hi-Res 3200 color format (PIC of 38400 bytes, file type
  $C1 and auxiliary type $0002).</li>
<li>Updated preferences to remember the following directory locations:<ul>
	<li>Open</li>
	<li>Save/Save As (new)</li>
	<li>Import (new)</li>
	<li>Export</li>
	<li>Compile</li>
	</ul>
<li>Added support for Finder Icons File ($CA or "ICN").</li>
<li>Added CP/M disk image support.</li>
<li>Restructured how AppleCommander manages disk ordering.  This simplifies the
  manner in which various disk ordering schemes are implemented, and makes it
  possible to translate between ordering schemes.</li>
<li>Support for nibble images (*.NIB) added.  Can read and write to the images
  as long as that format supports writing.</li>
<li>To support nibble images, changed the structure surrounding the disk image
  for a Disk.  There now is an ImageOrder which manages the ordering of data on
  the image and supplies low-level read and write routines (track/sector and 
  block).  An ImageOrder holds data in an image layout - this allows the generic
  byte array and 2IMG layouts to be abstracted away from an images order.  This
  does add interaction complexity but actually simplified the Disk class.
<li>Viewing or double-clicking on a directory will navigate into that directory.</li>
<li>Viewing a deleted file no longer crashes AppleCommander - a warning message
  is displayed.</li>
<li>Updated Export Graphics wizard and export right-click options.</li>
<li>Add the ability to change physical order too (DOS &lt;=&gt; ProDOS &lt;=&gt; Nibble)
  on 140KB images.</li>
<li>Add ability to compare disks - regardless of physical order.</li>
<li>Started using Gimp for images (instead of Microsoft Photo Draw 2).</li>
<li>Added a "View As" menu pick in context menu.  (Just Text or Graphics at this time.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
[The End.]
