<p>New for version 1.3.4 (2007-03-31):</p>

<ul>
<li>Started using the SWT S-Leak application to test for application resource leakage.</li>
<li>Reports of a few issues with 800K images.  UniDOS in particular doesn't appear to be
  recognized appropriately.  This was due to a mix-up in setting the the image ordering.</li>
<li>Fixed the bug where the import of a binary file does not set the address for DOS images.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that where a file cound not be exported as raw binary.  (Crashed AppleCommander.)</li>
<li>Raw binary files may now be imported - just check the raw image checkbox in the import
  wizard.</li>
<li>Prepare for internationalization (I18N).  Started as a simplification process but it
  got carried away.  Text is stored in text bundles throughout the code.  The files
  end with ____Bundle.properties.  The groupings are Storage, Compiler, Ui, and
  Text; directories relate to the package.  Contributions are more than welcome
  seeing as I know very little German and it's unlikely that I'll get my wife to
  spend time translating to Spanish.</li>
<li>Updates per Eclipse 3.0 recommendations.</li>
<li>Resolve OS X issues where window cannot come to the foreground. (J Matthews)</li>
<li>Add Apple Pascal writing capability. (J Matthews)</li>
</ul>

[The End.]
