<p>
A new release of AppleCommander is available! Version 1.2.2 continues 
on the general cleanup.  One new export filter of a generalized hex 
dump has been added and quite a bit of work in relation to ProDOS volumes. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>ProDOS disks now re-use deleted file entries.  Prior to this fix,
  deleted entries were never re-used.  If importing many files, a 
  "Disk Full" error would be generated rather quickly.</li>
<li>ProDOS file entries do not generate spurious file entries.  There
  was no method of detecting unused entries in pre-1.2.2 code.</li>
<li>Import file specification should only allow address editing if the filetype
  requires it.</li>
<li>Fixed parsing of filetype definitions for ProDOS volumes.</li>
<li>Need to be able to import into a directory in ProDOS.  This will most
  likely involve adding an interface indicating a (writable) directory.
  This interface would be applied to both disks as well as file entries,
  if appropriate.</li>
<li>ProDOS subdirectories need to allocate another block as they fill up; otherwise
  the directory is limited to the number of entries that fit within the allocated
  space.</li>
<li>Import now sports a progress indicator and identifies which file is being
  imported.</li>
<li>Popup dialogs are now centered above the controlling window instead of popping
  up randomly.</li>
<li>Added a Hex Dump file filter that displays offset into file, hex bytes, and
  the ASCII code.</li>
<li>AppleCommander is now being built by an ANT script instead of by the
  Eclipse menu pick.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm still putzing with a compiled version for Linux and Windows, so 
they haven't shown up as of yet.  (Unchanged - but not forgotten.)
