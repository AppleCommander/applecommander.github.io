A new release of AppleCommander is available.  Version 1.2.0 took a bit 
longer than expected, as I got distracted with other fun stuff in 
AppleCommander (hence, super-hires exports and AWP to RTF conversion):
</p>

<ul>
<li>Can now create disk images. For the moment, these images are not 
  bootable (including hard disk images) - they do however boot a 
  nifty title screen... </li>
<li>Files can now be imported into disks. Formats that support this 
  are DOS 3.3 and ProDOS formats. (Pascal and RDOS will come at a 
  later point.) </li>
<li>The AppleWorks export now has an option for exporting to 
  Rich-Text Format (RTF). This format can be loaded into many 
  word-processors easily. </li>
<li>The graphics export option now supports Super High-Res images. 
  Both unpacked and packed formats. These are essentially raw dumps 
  from the IIGS memory that were saved to disk. </li>
<li>Files can be deleted. </li>
<li>Any changes to a disk image can be saved. Please be careful! It's 
  easy enough to keep a backup copy of your work these days. </li>
<li>Two new DOS derivitaves are available: UniDOS and OzDOS (both are 
  800K formats). </li>
</ul>

<p>
A Linux and a Windows native executable is in the works. Be warned 
that they are still experimental. In particular, in the process of 
compiling, something about the code introduces delays (ie, click and 
wait a couple of seconds), and the graphics filter currently needs 
to be disabled, as GCJ does not support the graphics libraries that 
are being used.
